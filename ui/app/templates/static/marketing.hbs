      <p>The XJ<sup>&trade;</sup> Ambient Music Platform is an unprecedented execution of Eno's original charter for a music that is "heard but
        not listened to."</p>
      <p>Made with love and bleeding-edge technology, it is a patent-pending mathematical system, a
        cloud-based audio production platform, an A.I., and a web-browser-based app for musicians to compose and perform from anywhere.</p>
      <p>If you are extremely self-motivated, interested in earning passive income by creating content, and excited to define a new sound, please do say hiya!</p>
      <p>Sincerely,<br/>&quot;Nick&quot; Charney Kaye</p>

      <h1>XJ<sup>&trade;</sup> is the Future of Ambient Music for Institutions and Businesses.</h1>
      <p>Today, people listen to music on their personal devices. What is the future of ambient music in common
        areas?</p>
      <p>With the internet competing for their attention, visitors and customers hate to be overwhelmed by the wrong
        music.</p>
      <p>Research shows that the perfect music will please visitors, and arouse customers. XJ<sup>&trade;</sup> is the ultimate soundscape of never-before-heard music dynamically arranged in real time.</p>
      <p>Most importantly, XJ<sup>&trade;</sup> pays out the lion's share of revenue directly to the artists who compose and perform each second of source material, with extremely accurate
        rights attribution.</p>
      <p>The prototype is operational, and musicians are being invited now.</p>
      <p>The first sales effort is <a href="https://www.ambienceplatform.com/" target="_blank">Ambience<sup>&trade;</sup></a>.</p>
