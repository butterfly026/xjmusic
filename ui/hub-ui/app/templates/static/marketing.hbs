DO NOT USE HANDLEBARS IN THIS FILE, even though it is .hbs extension. See README.md in this folder for details

NOTE: The Handlebars {{#link-to 'path'}}Segment{{/link-to}} is required
because it is the only way to send a message to the Ember view,
and it is acceptable because it will be [#314] stripped using Regex before
this template is [#318] used as HTML in the static index.html content.

NOTE: html comments are stripped, including this one ;)

See: "inlineContent" option in ember-cli-build.js to understand how this comes together.
