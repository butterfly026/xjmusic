Royalties from XJ Music are distributed in proportion to revenue, based on relative contribution of creative work.

As an example, if the platform collects $100 in royalties for a given period:

  * &#8531; of revenue is retained by XJ Music Inc. towards software development and operations
  * &#8532; of revenue is distributed among the artists, directly proportional to each artist's contribution to the creative material sourced by the software platform in order to generate the musical composition against which said revenue has been collected.

In the future, there will be a more comprehensive formula disclosed here, as to the exact way revenue is divided among contributing artists.
