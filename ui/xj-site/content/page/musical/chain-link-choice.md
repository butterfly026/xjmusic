Music in the [XJ Music](https://hub.xj.io/login) is stored in Chains comprising of Links.

In the cloud, worker-bots construct the complex arrangements of events that comprise these Chains.

Work is performed sequentially, one Link after another. There are layers of work to be performed. First, each Link is "crafted," then, each Link is "dubbed."

## Craft: Macro & Main Choices for Link

In this section is described the algorithm by which the Craftworker performs Macro & Main choices for each Link.

### (A) Link: Initial

For the first Link in a Chain.

#### (A.1) Select Macro-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.2) Link Memes, Key, Density & Tempo = from First Phase of Macro-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.3) Select Main-Pattern based on Link Memes

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.4) Transpose Main-Pattern to Link Key

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.5) Link Memes += from First Phase of Main-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.6) Link Length (# Beats) = from First Phase of Main-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.7) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)

TODO: implement & document

### (B) Link: Continue Main-Pattern

For a sequential Link in a Chain, when the previous Link's Main-Pattern has remaining Phase(s).

#### (B.1) Continue Main-Pattern, if has Phase remaining

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.2) Link Key, Density & Tempo = next Phase of Main-Pattern, transposed to current Phase of Macro Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.3) Link Memes = next Phase of Main-Pattern + current Phase of Macro-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.4) Link Length (# Beats) = from current Phase of Main-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.5) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)

TODO: implement & document

### (C) Link: Next Main-Pattern, Continue Macro-Pattern

For a sequential Link in a Chain, when the previous Link reached the end of its Main-Pattern.

#### (C.1) Continue Macro-Pattern, if has 2 or more phases remaining

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.2) Link Memes, Key, Density & Tempo = from current Phase of Macro-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.3) Select Main-Pattern based on Link Memes

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.4) Transpose Main-Pattern to Link Key

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.5) Link Memes += from First Phase of Main-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.6) Link Length (# Beats) = from First Phase of Main-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.7) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)

TODO: implement & document

### (D) Link: Next Macro-Pattern

For a sequential Link in a Chain, when the previous Link's Macro-Pattern has only one more Phase remaining.

A Macro-type Pattern must have a minimum of two phases. The last phase of the Macro-pattern is never actually used; it is replaced by the first phase of the next Macro-pattern. However, the next Macro-pattern has been transposed according to the last Macro-pattern's final Phase.

#### (D.1) first phase of next Macro-Pattern will overlap (replacing) the last phase of the current Macro-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.2) Select next Macro-Pattern to overlap last phase of current

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.3) Link Memes, Key, Density & Tempo = from first Phase of new Macro-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.4) Select Main-Pattern based on Link Memes

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.5) Transpose Main-Pattern to Link Key

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.6) Link Memes += from First Phase of Main-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.7) Link Length (# Beats) = from First Phase of Main-Pattern

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.8) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)
