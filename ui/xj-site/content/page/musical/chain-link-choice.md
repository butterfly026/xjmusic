Music in the [XJ Ambient Music Platform](https://hub.xj.io/login) is stored in Chains comprising of Links.

In the cloud, worker-bots construct the complex arrangements of events that comprise these Chains.

Work is performed sequentially, one Link after another. There are layers of work to be performed. First, each Link is "crafted," then, each Link is "dubbed."

## Craft: Macro & Main Choices for Link

In this section is described the algorithm by which the Craftworker performs Macro & Main choices for each Link.

### (A) Link: Initial

For the first Link in a Chain.

#### (A.1) Select Macro-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.2) Link Memes, Key, Density & Tempo = from First Phase of Macro-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.3) Select Main-Idea based on Link Memes

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.4) Transpose Main-Idea to Link Key

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.5) Link Memes += from First Phase of Main-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.6) Link Length (# Beats) = from First Phase of Main-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (A.7) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)

TODO: implement & document

### (B) Link: Continue Main-Idea

For a sequential Link in a Chain, when the previous Link's Main-Idea has remaining Phase(s).

#### (B.1) Continue Main-Idea, if has Phase remaining

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.2) Link Key, Density & Tempo = next Phase of Main-Idea, transposed to current Phase of Macro Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.3) Link Memes = next Phase of Main-Idea + current Phase of Macro-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.4) Link Length (# Beats) = from current Phase of Main-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (B.5) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)

TODO: implement & document

### (C) Link: Next Main-Idea, Continue Macro-Idea

For a sequential Link in a Chain, when the previous Link reached the end of its Main-Idea.

#### (C.1) Continue Macro-Idea, if has 2 or more phases remaining

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.2) Link Memes, Key, Density & Tempo = from current Phase of Macro-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.3) Select Main-Idea based on Link Memes

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.4) Transpose Main-Idea to Link Key

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.5) Link Memes += from First Phase of Main-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.6) Link Length (# Beats) = from First Phase of Main-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (C.7) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)

TODO: implement & document

### (D) Link: Next Macro-Idea

For a sequential Link in a Chain, when the previous Link's Macro-Idea has only one more Phase remaining.

A Macro-type Idea must have a minimum of two phases. The last phase of the Macro-idea is never actually used; it is replaced by the first phase of the next Macro-idea. However, the next Macro-idea has been transposed according to the last Macro-idea's final Phase.

#### (D.1) first phase of next Macro-Idea will overlap (replacing) the last phase of the current Macro-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.2) Select next Macro-Idea to overlap last phase of current

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.3) Link Memes, Key, Density & Tempo = from first Phase of new Macro-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.4) Select Main-Idea based on Link Memes

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.5) Transpose Main-Idea to Link Key

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.6) Link Memes += from First Phase of Main-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.7) Link Length (# Beats) = from First Phase of Main-Idea

TODO: implement & document

#### (D.8) Link Length Time = Link Tempo (time per Beat) * Link Length (# Beats)
