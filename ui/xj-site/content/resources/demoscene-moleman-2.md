Although existing art media have been transformed in the digital age, the advent of computers has brought new art forms into being. In the past, visual arts and music required both intellectual and physical skills, but in the present, computer programming permits people to make art just by using their minds. Moleman 2 presents a subculture of digital artists working with both new and old computing technology who push their machines to their limits.

The demoscene is a computer art subculture centered around demos, which are generally non-interactive audiovisual presentations that run realtime on computers and demonstrate programming, artistic, and musical skills.

The demoscene first appeared during the 8-bit era on computers such as the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC, and came to prominence during the rise of 16 and 32-bit systems, such as the Atari ST and Amiga. Initially, demos had a strong connection with software cracking. When a cracked program loaded, the cracker or his team would take credit with a graphical introduction called a "crack intro" (later shortened to "cracktro"). Eventually, creation of intros and standalone demos evolved into a new subculture independent of the cracking scene.
