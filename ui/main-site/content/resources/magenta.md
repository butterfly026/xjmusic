Magenta is a project from the Google Brain team that asks: Can we use machine learning to create compelling art and music? If so, how? If not, why not? We’ll use TensorFlow, and we’ll release our models and tools in open source on this GitHub. We’ll also post demos, tutorial blog postings, and technical papers. If you’d like to keep up on Magenta as it grows, you can read our blog and or join our discussion group.
