Iamus is a computer cluster (a half-cabinet encased in a custom shell) located at Universidad de Málaga. Powered by Melomics' technology, the composing module of Iamus takes 8 minutes to create a full composition in different musical formats, although the native representation can be obtained by the whole system in less than a second (on average). Iamus only composes full pieces of contemporary classical music.<p/>It's first album <em>Iamus</em> is credited by New Scientist as the &quot;first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians.&quot;
