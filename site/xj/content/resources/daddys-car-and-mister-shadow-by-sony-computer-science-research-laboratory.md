Scientists at SONY CSL Research Lab *claimed* to have created the first-ever entire songs composed by Artificial Intelligence: [Daddy's Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHZ_b05W7o) and [Mister Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcGYEXJqun8)&mdash;however, the truth behind this stunt reveals the need for a system of music that is aided by AI, however still based on human musical composition.
