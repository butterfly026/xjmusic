XJ is an ambient music stream: non-stop original music assembled in real-time by an AI, using parts created by Musicians.
 
## Our Mission: to disrupt music recording and playback by challenging the traditional static model with a dynamic, collaborative, information age platform.    

Instead of making records, Musicians create and upload content as partial layers, sequences of information, and recorded audio, from which the AI chooses and arranges.

Musicians are paid ongoing royalties according to precise revenue tracking for each time their contributions are chosen by the AI.
