There are two types of **Events**, the **Idea Phase Voice-Event** and the **Instrument Audio-Event**. Automatic fabrication performs a search for matching Instrument Audio-Events for the chosen Idea Phase Voice-Events. That is how an Audio is chosen inside of an Instrument, based on its Audio-Events.

It is important for percussive-type instruments to use the following standardized set of Event Inflections, which have far more influence on the outcome of percussive instrument-audio choice (than, for example, Event Notes).

Percussive-type Instrument Audio-Event Inflections are:
